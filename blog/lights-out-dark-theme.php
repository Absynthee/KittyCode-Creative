                    <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Why Offer Light and Dark Themes?</h4>

                    <p>While it might seem like just a design choice, allowing users to toggle between themes offers
                        real benefits. A&nbsp;dark&nbsp;theme can reduce eye strain, especially in low-light
                        environments, making
                        those late-night browsing sessions far more comfortable. Alternatively, the light theme ensures
                        readability during the day or in bright settings.</p>

                    <p>Beyond aesthetics, offering a theme switch improves accessibility. Users with certain visual
                        impairments often benefit from adjustable contrast, allowing them to interact more comfortably
                        with the site.</p>

                    <p>As well as that, when it comes down to user preferences it's better to have more people be able
                        to enjoy your website without their eyes being blinded by the pure white background. </p>

                    <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Why We Made the Switch</h4>

                    <p>As dark modes become increasingly popular across devices, we felt it was essential to provide
                        this option for our visitors. Whether you’re a fan of the dark side or prefer the brightness of
                        a light theme, we’ve ensured that your experience on our website is as comfortable and engaging
                        as possible.</p>

                    <p>Why it took so long? With more colours and code being added, there are more variables and more
                        testing is required. However, it's absolutely the investment.</p>

                    <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Making Your Browsing Experience More Personal</h4>

                    <p>Our goal is to give you control over how you engage with our content. Personal preferences
                        matter, and whether you like your screens bright or dim, we’ve got you covered. So, try out the
                        new toggle, and see which theme works best for you!</p>

                    <h4 class="blog-subtitle">Light and Dark Mode Included for Every Client</h4>

                    <p>Every website we design and develop for our clients will now include both light and dark mode
                        functionality as standard. We believe in giving you the tools to provide a modern and accessible
                        browsing experience for your visitors. Whether it's a sleek dark interface or a bright and
                        vibrant design, your website will have it all!</p>

                    <p>Are you team Light Mode or Dark Mode? Give it a go and let us know which side you’re on!</p>
